Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional form while retaining as much variance as possible. This is particularly useful for visualization and improving the performance of machine learning algorithms on high-dimensional datasets.

I utilized the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset from scikit-learn, which contains 569 samples with 30 numerical features each. The target variable indicates whether a tumor is malignant or benign.
